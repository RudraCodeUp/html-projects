            <p>"Adventure", a common word that is used but a descriptive one none the less. The book does not only speak of a hobbit going on an adventure but aims its energy at the reader to take them on an adventure. It might might not sound exciting at the very beginning but to be honestly all books start from a subtle low until they reach an extremely high climax.</p>

            <p>"To Kill a Mockingbird" is a great novel and the best one to start with. It's a story that revolves around a sibling (jem and scout) and their lives which bring some unexpected twist and turns while living with their only single parent i.e. their father Atticus and caretaker Calpurnia.</p>

            <img src="C:\Users\rhyth\OneDrive\Desktop\html\html-projects\book review\images_books\jude.jpeg" style="width: 300; height: 400;">
            <p> Historical romance portraying two souls those were meant to be together forever despite of hundred years of gap... just a fraction of imagination for the people around the world...where two persons has twice fallen in love... leaving all technical, modern, traditional aspects of world aside...</p>

            <p>Humorous, antic and comic masterpiece is how I would describe Three Men in a Boat, Jerome K. Jerome really writes wonders!</p>
